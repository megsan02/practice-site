      This is Fat Tina. Her full name is Valentina after the first woman to go to space, but we call her Fat Tina because she is a chunky girl. She loves to eat, and chicken is her favorite thing in the world. She is convinced that every bird outside is a chicken and she is determined to catch all of them and gobble them down. She loves to sleep after she's done eating, and then she wakes up and eats again. She likes to play but often gets too tired and ends up eating and falling asleep at her food bowl.
